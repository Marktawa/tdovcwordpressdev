                    <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <h1>Background & Motivation</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Persons with Disabilities are the single largest marginalized group among vulnerable
                        populations. They face challenges in accessing basic necessities and services such as Health,
                        Education, Social and Economic Opportunities. In Kafue District, the closure of the state
                        enterprises in the middle 1990s has negatively impacted the social-economic wellbeing of the
                        historically industrial town. Specifically, the fall of jobs and economic opportunities has
                        significantly reduced the delivery of quality health and education services. The effect of this
                        situation among persons with disabilities especially, children, cannot be over emphasized.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the Education sector, most government managed schools have inappropriate infrastructure and
                        lack support systems such as school based personal assistants, special needs teachers and
                        disability friendly teaching aids. This situation has disproportionately affected learners with
                        disabilities. This is also affirmed in the National Disability Survey of 2015, which showed
                        that, only 60% of eligible school children with disabilities were in school compared to about
                        83% of children without disabilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2008, the Ministry of Education through the District Education Board Secretary Office adopted
                        all the 150 learners with disabilities from Twatasha Community School and enrolled them in
                        mainstream government primary schools in Kafue District. However, before the fall of 2009, 90
                        percent of the learners adopted dropped out of school. Our preliminary findings showed that the
                        government schools lacked an enabling environment to promote the inclusion and retention of
                        learners with disabilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With this finding, Twatasha Disabled and OVC Organization was re-established to provide
                        inclusive education to children with disabilities and other Orphaned and Vulnerable Children in
                        Kafue District.</p>
                    <p>
                        With the support of the local community, Twatasha Community School was built in 2012 and
                        resourced to provide education to learners with disability and other vulnerable children.

                    <h2>Rationale</h2>
                    <p>The initiative was created upon the realization of the existing gap characterized by lack of

                        among children with disabilities and other orphans and vulnerable children in Kafue. The
                        initiative was founded by persons that had personal experience of the challenges of disability,
                        poverty and had overcome the vices through resilience, participation and self-advocacy.

                    <p>
                        Despite the successes the organization has scored over the years, we face challenges resulting
                        from the overwhelming response and demand for our services in the community. As such our
                        resources have limited our capacity to meet the growing needs and expectations of our
                        communities. In the quest to address this challenge, the organization has continued to cultivate
                        value driven, like-minded partnerships and alliances to tap into the expertise and resources.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is however, a huge opportunity to meet the challenges above. Below are some opportunities
                        available to enhance and improve the existing programmes:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Growing demand from our communities</li>
                        <li>Fewer organizations providing support to Children with Disabilities and their families</li>
                        <li>Availability of networking opportunities among key stakeholders and service providers</li>
                        <li>Local ownership and community trust in the organization</li>
